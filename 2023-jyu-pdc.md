## Scaling up during 2020: effective team work

<img src="img/scaling-up.png" style="width: 50%;"/>

- Before 2020: ~25 participants, ~2 helpers
- Now: routinely 100+ participants, 20+ helpers
- Lectures & code-along exercises in the main room: .emph[stream and also record]
- Get help and group exercises in a breakout room
- Participants can register as teams (.emph["bring your own breakout room"])
- Installation sessions and helper preparation sessions
- Asynchronous Q&A via [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) ->
  we publish these ([example](https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-10-20-online/#questions-answers-and-feedback))

## Recent feedback

> "I take this chance to congratulate once more for the very appreciated workshop.
> I really enjoyed all the sessions, this is something I have been looking for
> for a couple of years now and that I will strongly advertise between my
> colleagues.  In particular, I would like to congratulate you for your
> professionalism and for having made the most of all the potential of distance
> learning, without ever complaining about its obvious and unnecessary
> limitations. The team effort during the classes was impressive. Also, the
> material available to support the classes is excellent and I am sure I will
> exploit it in the future."

## FAIR software

- https://fair-software.eu/
- ["Towards FAIR principles for research software", Lamprecht et al., Data Science, vol. 3, no. 1, 37-59, 2020](https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-190026)
- Also: documentation, code review, version control for dependencies


### FAIR principles have many aspects

- Principles
- Best practices
- Policies
- Standards
- Governance model
- Development of tools
- .emph[Training] (version control, notebooks, documentation, code review, version control for dependencies, licenses, testing)
- .emph[Mentorship]

# What is CodeRefinery?

## CodeRefinery's biggest development may not be *teaching*...

## ... is it *teaching together*?

---

## Value of the network and teamwork: success stories

### Python course

- Instead of each site developing their own course, we combined efforts:
  https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/
- New edition of this course coming October


### Research Software Hour

- Bi-weekly online stream/show about scientific computing and research software
- https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/


### Instructor training

- 3 instructor training events in one year, co-organized across
  borders


### GitLab hosting for Nordic research software

- 400 active users, 800 active projects: https://coderefinery.org/repository/

---

## CodeRefinery 2023: .emph[Community project]


### Primary tasks

- Classic "CodeRefinery workshops" with focus on best software practices, organized by partners
- Own training: both open tracks and sponsored personalized courses
- Coordinate other shared collaborative training events
- Train the trainer


### Additional goals

- Continue coordinating Carpentries events in Nordics/Baltic countries
- Driving/supporting Nordic research software engineers (RSE) network
- Support professional development of RSEs
- Improve towards a more inclusive community and better gender balance

---

## Future/challenges

- Towards a non-profit organization
- Make it easier for organizations and individuals to join
- Give .emph[better credit] for volunteer contributions
- Offer not only training but also mentorship network
- FAIR software practices survey
- How to better advertise and reach and connect the community?
